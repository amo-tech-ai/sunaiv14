# Client Dashboard: Phased Delivery Model

## Philosophy
The dashboard is structured to guide clients through a logical maturity curve. We avoid overwhelming them with "everything at once" by strictly separating **CORE** (Foundation) from **ADVANCED** (Automation).

## Phase 1: CORE FOUNDATION
**"Get the fundamentals right."**

This phase focuses on visibility and measurement. We do not implement complex automation here. We ensure the data is clean and the brand is clear.

### Included Deliverables:
1.  **Digital Footprint Audit**: Ensure website, SEO, and listings are indexed.
2.  **Analytics Infrastructure**: GA4, Meta Pixel, and Server-Side tagging.
3.  **Brand Positioning**: Clear value prop and visual identity consistency.
4.  **Baseline Reporting**: First true look at CAC and conversion rates.

**Client Value**: "I finally know where my traffic is coming from and what it costs."

## Phase 2: ADVANCED AUTOMATION
**"Make it faster and smarter."**

Once CORE is active (verified data), we unlock this phase. This is where "AI Agents" and "Workflows" technically live, but we present them as business outcomes.

### Included Deliverables:
1.  **Automated Lead Routing**: Instant response to new inquiries.
2.  **CRM Enrichment**: Auto-populating lead data (size, revenue) via API.
3.  **Smart Nurture**: Behavioral email sequences based on user actions.
4.  **Ops Dashboard**: Internal alerts for high-value activities.

**Client Value**: "My team stopped doing manual data entry and started selling."

## Phase 3: SCALING (Future)
**"Optimize and expand."**

Locked until Automation is stable.

### Focus:
- Predictive AI (Lead Scoring)
- Multi-channel expansion
- High-volume experimentation

## UI Implementation Rules
1.  **CORE** is always expanded by default on load.
2.  **ADVANCED** is visible but "Locked" or "Pending" to show the roadmap without distracting.
3.  **No Jargon**: Avoid "Orchestrator Agent" in client titles. Use "Automated Routing" instead.
